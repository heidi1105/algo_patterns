## Concept
- Having multiple pointers that referencing different position of an array so that elements can be kept track of and compared at the same time 

## Examples
- pointers from the start & the end moving towards each other
- fast & slow pointers in linked list
- to merge 2 sorted arrays
- comparing 1 pointer while moving the other pointer
- sliding window
