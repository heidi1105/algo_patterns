# String & Hashmap


## Concept
- Having multiple pointers that referencing different position of an array so that elements can be kept track of and compared at the same time 

## Examples
- pointers from the start & the end moving towards each other
- fast & slow pointers in linked list
- to merge 2 sorted arrays
- comparing 1 pointer while moving the other pointer
- sliding window


## Steps
1. Decide on the table type you need (set? hashmap? What should be the key & what should be the values) and instantiate it. 
2. Putting elements into the hashmap (Takes O(n))
3. After the hashmap is created, how to retrieve the data to complete the task
   - If-statement? .sort first? Loop through the map?
